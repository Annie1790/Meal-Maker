# Meal-Maker
Codecademy project practicing. 

A restaurant has hired you to create a function for their website that 
allows them to set a meal and price each morning for Today’s Special. 
Use your knowledge of getters and setters to make sure anyone who uses the new 
function can generate a meal and a price for 
Today’s Special without any embarrassing errors!


Things I have learned with this project is:

1. I used more properties which are not altered.
2. I created this in a function which will return the getter value todaysSpecial.
3. After creating the setters, I assigned the parameters to the properties in my function.


I will add some design to this project in the future.
